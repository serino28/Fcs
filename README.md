This is a project that explores python's pandas library through the development of 12 queries on three datasets provided: the first 11 deal with general topics including selection, projection, grouping and sorting operations on dataframes, while the 12th is a slightly deeper query that, in addition to the previous operations, touches on the topic of text mining.

You will find in the "Dataset" folder the three datasets useful for the development of the project, while in the notebook "FCS_Antonio_Serino_886757" the code in which you can observe queries and their results.
